Netflix Data Analysis Project
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of Netflix's content catalog, exploring various trends and insights. The project aims to uncover patterns in genres, release dates, and cast information to understand the factors influencing Netflix's content strategy and audience preferences.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Initial steps to handle missing values, format data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of the dataset to identify key characteristics, trends, and relationships between different variables.

Data Visualization: Creating visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to represent the findings in an easy-to-understand format.

Insight Generation: Drawing conclusions from the data to provide insights into popular genres, top-performing actors/directors, and the distribution of content over time.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from a public repository, such as Kaggle. It contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including details like title, director, cast, country, release year, duration, and listed genres.
